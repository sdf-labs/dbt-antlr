//! Mutual (indirect) left-recursion elimination — issue #151.
//!
//! ANTLR 4 rewrites *direct* left recursion (`e : e '+' e | INT`) into a
//! precedence-climbing rule, but rejects *mutual* (indirect) left recursion — a
//! left-corner cycle through two or more rules — with `error(119)`. This pass
//! accepts the tractable subclass of those cycles by rewriting them, on the
//! model, into an equivalent grammar that uses only *direct* left recursion, so
//! the existing [`rewrite_immediate_left_recursion`](super::left_recursion)
//! machinery (and, as a differential oracle, ANTLR itself) can handle them.
//!
//! The rewrite is **left-corner substitution** ("hub inlining"): for each
//! left-corner cycle, one member is chosen as the *hub*; every other member (a
//! *satellite*) reachable in left-corner position from the hub has its
//! alternatives spliced into the hub, in place, until the hub is directly
//! left-recursive. Satellites referenced only from within the cycle are then
//! removed; a satellite referenced from outside the cycle is retained unchanged
//! (its body already calls the hub, which is now the precedence rule).
//!
//! # Structure: decide, then act
//!
//! The pass is organised so that **every** decision is made against the
//! untouched model, before anything is mutated:
//!
//! 1. [`plan_cycle`] proves the whole rewrite is admissible and returns a
//!    [`CyclePlan`], or `None`. It allocates nothing and mutates nothing.
//! 2. [`apply_plan`] performs the planned splice. It is mechanical and cannot
//!    fail.
//!
//! That ordering is what makes the safety claim real: an inadmissible cycle is
//! left **bit-for-bit untouched and silent** — no IDs consumed, no provenance
//! written — so the downstream ATN-level `G4A005` detector reports it exactly as
//! it does today. The alternative (mutate, then check) previously lost
//! `<assoc=right>`, element labels, rule arguments and `*`-quantified corners by
//! dropping them mid-splice.
//!
//! # What is required of a cycle
//!
//! [`Requirements`] spells out the preconditions. In brief: the grammar must be
//! a parser grammar; every substituted left corner must be a *bare* call to a
//! cycle member — no quantifier, no label, no arguments, and nothing
//! token-consuming or nullable before it; satellites must carry no rule-level
//! attributes (arguments, returns, locals, `@init`/`@after`, `catch`/`finally`)
//! that inlining would silently drop; and the resulting hub must be a shape the
//! direct-recursion classifier already accepts. Anything else is declined.
//!
//! See `docs/issue-151-mutual-left-recursion-plan.md` for the full design and
//! the empirical validation against `dotnet/roslyn`'s `CSharp.Generated.g4`.
